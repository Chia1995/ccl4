## Reflections on the Own Project
*(List and explain what you could improve and add if you have more time.)*

1. If I had more time, I would definitely improve the animation of the death character. I’m not entirely satisfied with how it turned out, but due to time constraints, I couldn’t refine it as much as I wanted. With more time, I would focus on making the movement smoother and more expressive to better match the dramatic moment when the character appears.  
2. Item
