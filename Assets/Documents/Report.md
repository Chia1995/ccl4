## Implementation Logic Explanation
*(Explain how you implement the idea step by step compactly and clearly.)*

## Three Important Achievements
*(List and explain 3 important achievements you are proud of (e.g., features, techniques, etc.) in the project. Please explain in detail.)*  

1. Creating trippy Shader with Shadertoy. Shader is used on the Sphere which follows the position of the player  
2. Creation and Animation of 3D Models and Scene Elements
The creation of the mushroom, death character, and player models, along with their animations, was a major achievement. Each model was carefully designed, rigged, and animated to fit the game’s surreal theme. The death character's entrance when the player loses adds strong visual feedback. Additionally, several scene elements like mushrooms, hearts, and background objects were custom-made to create a consistent and immersive environment.

## Major Challenges and Solutions
*(List and explain the major challenges. Did you solve it? How? Please explain in detail.)*

1. Baking Textures in Blender
One of the biggest challenges we faced was baking textures in Blender. We weren’t able to get the desired results on our own, which affected the visual quality of our models. With the help of Hannes, we were able to understand the process and fix the issue. This allowed us to correctly apply textures and improve the overall appearance of our assets in Unity.

## Reflections on the Own Project
*(List and explain what you could improve and add if you have more time.)*

1. If I had more time, I would definitely improve the animation of the death character. I’m not entirely satisfied with how it turned out, but due to time constraints, I couldn’t refine it as much as I wanted. With more time, I would focus on making the movement smoother and more expressive to better match the dramatic moment when the character appears.
