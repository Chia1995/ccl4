# 2. üéÆ Game Logic

This game is an infinite runner where the player navigates forward across a series of ground tiles, collecting items and avoiding obstacles to survive and achieve the highest score possible. The core mechanics are based on speed progression, obstacle avoidance, and item collection.

---

### üöÄ Core Gameplay Flow

- The player character **automatically runs forward**.
- The environment is made of **ground tiles** that continuously spawn as the player progresses.
- Each tile may randomly spawn:
  - **Obstacles** (e.g., walls, mushroom).
  - **Coins** to increase score.
  - **Heart collectibles** to restore lost lives.

---

### üßç Player Controls

- The player can:
  - **Switch between three lanes** (left, center, right).
  - **Jump** to avoid obstacles.
- **Falling off the ground** or **hitting an obstacle** results in losing a life.

---

### üíî Health & Game Over Logic

- The player starts with **3 lives**, visually shown as heart icons.
- A life is lost when:
  - The player **collides with an obstacle** (e.g., wall or mushroom).
  - The player **falls off the ground**.
- The player can **restore one life** by collecting a **heart** (if lives are below 3).
- The game ends if:
  - The player **loses all 3 lives**.
  - The player's **score drops below 0** (from hitting obstacles).

---

### üí∞ Score System

- Collecting a **coin** increases the score by **+1**.
- Hitting an obstacle deducts **‚àí20 points** from the current score.
- If the score becomes **less than 0**, it's **game over**.
- The player's movement speed increases slightly as the score increases, making the game harder over time.

---

### üîÑ Restarting the Game

- On game over, the player is taken to a **Game Over** screen.
- From there, the player can:
  - **Restart** the game with full lives and zero score.
  - **Quit** the application to return to the `StartGame` scene.


# 3. Motivation
Don't Die High is a 3D endless runner where the player races along a colorful rainbow road through a psychedelic world. The aim is to survive and achieve a high score by collecting coins and hearts to restore lives. The player must avoid poisonous mushrooms and jump over walls ‚Äî because each mistake costs a life. When a life is lost, Death begins to chase the player, adding tension. As the player runs, Death gradually falls behind and disappears ‚Äî until the next mistake. Our motivation was to blend vibrant visuals, fast-paced action, and a subtle message: don't overdo it.

# 5. Game Audio

This project uses **Audiokinetic Wwise** as the audio middleware, integrated with Unity, to provide advanced sound design and music management. Wwise enables flexible handling of soundbanks, events, and real-time audio control for both sound effects and music.

### Audio Workflow Summary
- **Wwise Integration:** Audio assets and events are managed in the Wwise Authoring Application and imported into Unity. Soundbanks are generated for each platform and kept in `ccl4_WwiseProject/GeneratedSoundBanks/`.
- **Triggering Sounds:** Sounds are triggered in Unity either by attaching Wwise components (such as `AkEvent`, `AkAmbient`, `AkAudioListener`, `AkGameObj`) to GameObjects, or by calling Wwise events from scripts using `AkSoundEngine.PostEvent("EventName", gameObject);`.
- **Adding/Modifying Audio:** To add or change sounds, import new audio files into the Wwise project, create or update events, regenerate soundbanks, and assign events in Unity as needed.
- **Music & Ambience:** Background music and ambience are managed through Wwise Music Segments and States, allowing for dynamic and interactive audio.

For a full guide to the audio pipeline, Wwise integration, and step-by-step instructions for adding or modifying sounds, **see [`AUDIO_IMPLEMENTATION.md`](AUDIO_IMPLEMENTATION.md)** in the project root.

# 6. System Design

## Overview

This Unity game features a modular design with distinct systems for player control, environment, collectibles, enemies, power-ups, and UI.

## Core Systems

### Player Movement (`PlayerMovement.cs`)

- Auto-runs, lane-switches, jumps using the Input System.
- Speed increases with coins collected.
- Restarts if player falls below y = -5.
- Uses Rigidbody and Animator.
- Updates GameManager for speed.

### Game Management (`GameManager.cs`)

- Singleton that tracks score (coins increase, obstacles decrease), lives (hitCount, max 3), and game state.
- Game over is triggered if `hitCount >= 3` or score <= 0.
- Updates UI elements (`TextMeshProUGUI`, `LivesUI`).
- Handles scene transitions.

### Tile Generation (`GroundSpawner.cs`, `GroundTile.cs`)

- Spawns tiles for an endless path.
- Tiles add obstacles (random positions) and coins.
- Tiles are destroyed after player passes.
- Uses colliders; GroundSpawner triggers GroundTile spawning.

### Collectibles (`Collectibles.cs`, `LifeHeart.cs`, `LifeHeartSpawner.cs`)

- Coins follow a random pattern, rotate, and add score.
- Life hearts spawn if `hitCount > 0` and restore life.
- Use collider triggers and are destroyed if behind player.
- Update GameManager accordingly.

### Power-Ups (`MagnetPowerup.cs`, `PlayerMagnet.cs`, `MagnetSpawner.cs`)

- Magnets spawn periodically and attract collectibles for 5 seconds.
- Use collider triggers and are destroyed if behind player.
- PlayerMagnet handles attraction logic.

### Obstacles (`Obstacle.cs`, `MovingObstacle.cs`)

- Static and moving obstacles increase `hitCount` and reduce score.
- Use colliders and notify GameManager on collision.

### UI (`LivesUI.cs`, `GameOverUI.cs`, `MainMenuUI.cs`, `SceneLoader.cs`)

- Displays lives (heart icons), score, final score, and menu options.
- Uses `Image`, `TextMeshProUGUI`, and `Button`.
- Driven by GameManager state.

### Camera (`CameraFollow.cs`)

- Tracks player with a fixed offset, locks x position at 0.
- Updated in `LateUpdate` to smooth movement.

### Villain (`VillainFollower.cs`)

- Follows the player.
- Attempts to catch the player when `hitCount >= 3`.
- Uses Animator for animations.

## Interactions

- Player updates GameManager for score, lives, and speed.
- GroundSpawner and GroundTile generate the path with obstacles and coins.(Procedural environment with tile-based spawning and destruction.)
- Collectibles, power-ups, and obstacles interact with GameManager.
- UI reflects current GameManager state.
- Camera and villain track player position.

### Architecture Highlights
- Component-based and modular for easy maintenance and extension.
- Procedural environment with tile-based spawning and destruction.
- Input handled via Unity's Input System for smooth controls.
- Power-ups and collectibles interact through collision triggers.
- Simple enemy AI focused on pursuit and capture logic.

This structure supports scalable, manageable gameplay mechanics and smooth player experience.


# 7. System Infrastructure

The diagram below illustrates the core structure and class relationships within the game. It demonstrates how key components‚Äîsuch as the `GameManager`, player movement, collectibles, UI elements, and power-ups‚Äîare built on top of Unity's `MonoBehaviour` and interact with each other during runtime.

      - `StartGame` (start menu scene)
      - `MainGameScene` (game scene)
      - `GameOverScene` (game over scene)
---

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ How to Play
- **Movement:** Use `A` to move to the right and `D` to move to the left
- **Jump:** Press `Spacebar` to jump.
- **Collect items:** Collect coins to get a score, collect a magnet to get all nearby coins automatically
